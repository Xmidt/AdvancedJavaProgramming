Advanced Java Programming
=======================

Course Description
------------------

Programming systems software requires managing complexity. 
Among the myriad of software programming languages which are used to build
systems, Java has gained prominence recently, as evidenced by projects 
such as JBoss, Tomcat, Lucene, and Hadoop. In this course, we take a look at Java 
and the available programming techniques and paradigms which make it an excellent tool to
develop concurrent, distributed systems. This is not a beginner Java course
and is intended for students with basic understanding in structured and
object-oriented Java programming.
 
The course aims to train students in the mechanisms necessary to build
multithreaded distributed software services and their communication
interfaces using the Java platform. The students will be familiarized 
with advanced Java programming concepts such as type polymorphism (using Generics) 
and type introspection (using Reflection) to aid elegant system design. Students
will learnto tune performance of Java Virtual Machines. The course is designed as
a short workshop-mode intensive course over a week with a greater focus
on hands-on programming rather than slide-only teaching.
 
The learning goals of the course are:
1. Implement multi-threaded Java programs. 
2. Build distributed programs with network communication as the primary
form of communication.
3. Use the Java platform as a tool to build distributed concurrent 
systems and reason about their behavior.
4. Make effective use of Java generics in elegant system design.
5. Use Reflection for runtime code generation.
6. Analyze and tune the performance of an application running on the Java Virtual Machine. 
7. Use database adaptors to connect to databases.
 
The syllabus for the course is:
1. Concurrency.
2. Network communication.
3. HTTP communication library. (Jetty)
4. Generics.
5. Reflection.
6. Performance tuning of JVM.
7. Database adaptors like JDBC.
